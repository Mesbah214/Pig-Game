# Pig Game

Pig is a dice game where players take turns rolling a die until they roll a 1 or choose to stop and score their total. The game is for two to six players, and players can add points to their score for each 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 they roll. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose their score for the turn. The first player to reach a certain point wins.
